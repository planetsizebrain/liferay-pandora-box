Liferay Pandora's Box
=====================

A set of powerful/handy portlets for use in the Liferay Control Panel.

- fakesmtp-hook: a simple hook that acts as a SMTP endpoint (configure your portal-ext.properties to use localhost:2525) that your Liferay emails can get sent to which also provides a GUI to view their content.
- lfm-portlet: a portlet that allows you to traverse the file/directory tree and execute actions on them.
